# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a clone of Lovable.dev, an AI-powered web application development platform. The clone will enable users to build full-stack web applications through natural language prompts, providing an intuitive interface for rapid prototyping and development without requiring extensive coding knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or non-technical user, I want to create web applications using natural language descriptions, so that I can rapidly prototype and build applications without writing code manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language prompt describing an application THEN the system SHALL generate a complete web application structure
2. WHEN a user provides application requirements THEN the system SHALL create appropriate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
3. WHEN a user requests specific functionality THEN the system SHALL implement the requested features in the generated code
4. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on the generation process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview and interact with my generated application in real-time, so that I can see how my application looks and functions before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application is generated THEN the system SHALL display a live preview in an embedded iframe
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the preview SHALL update automatically without manual refresh
3. WHEN a user interacts with the preview THEN all functionality SHALL work as intended
4. WHEN the preview loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and work across different screen sizes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit and modify the generated code directly, so that I can customize and refine my application beyond the initial AI generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views generated code THEN the system SHALL provide a code editor with syntax highlighting
2. WHEN a user modifies code in the editor THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the live preview
3. WHEN a user makes code changes THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and show errors if present
4. WHEN a user wants to revert changes THEN the system SHALL provide version history and rollback functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and deploy my application, so that I can share it with others or use it in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes their application THEN the system SHALL provide export options for the complete codebase
2. WHEN a user requests deployment THEN the system SHALL offer integration with popular hosting platforms
3. WHEN exporting code THEN the system SHALL include all necessary files and dependencies
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide a shareable URL for the live application

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple projects and save my work, so that I can organize different applications and continue working on them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an application THEN the system SHALL automatically save the project
2. WHEN a user returns to the platform THEN they SHALL see a list of their saved projects
3. WHEN a user selects a saved project THEN the system SHALL restore the complete application state
4. WHEN a user wants to organize projects THEN the system SHALL provide naming and categorization options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to iterate on my application with additional prompts, so that I can refine and enhance my application through conversational development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides follow-up prompts THEN the system SHALL modify the existing application accordingly
2. WHEN making iterative changes THEN the system SHALL preserve existing functionality unless explicitly requested to change
3. WHEN a user requests specific modifications THEN the system SHALL apply changes to the appropriate files
4. WHEN iterating THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of all prompts and changes made

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to support modern web technologies and frameworks, so that my applications are built with current best practices and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating applications THEN the system SHALL use modern HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript
2. WHEN appropriate THEN the system SHALL suggest and implement popular frameworks like React, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript
3. WHEN building responsive designs THEN the system SHALL use modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid
4. WHEN adding interactivity THEN the system SHALL implement clean, maintainable JavaScript patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to handle authentication and user management, so that my projects are secure and personalized to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits THEN the system SHALL provide registration and login functionality
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them securely and maintain session state
3. WHEN accessing projects THEN the system SHALL ensure users can only view and edit their own projects
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL securely end their session and protect their data
